# Car Crash Prediction project for ITI competition 
# Overview
This project aims to predict the severity of car crashes using various machine learning techniques. By analyzing and modeling traffic data, the objective is to identify key factors that contribute to the severity of accidents and predict future occurrences. This could potentially aid in improving road safety measures and traffic management.

# Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the trends and patterns
Feature engineering to extract and select relevant information
Training a machine learning model to predict accident severity
# Technologies Used
Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn
